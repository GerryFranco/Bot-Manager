This project demonstrates the powerful capabilities of C++/CLI for native and managed interoperability 
using a real-world development scenario.

## Introduction

If you've ever developed for a company specializing in electronics or national defense, you've probably encountered your fair share 
of C++. Heck, the language's proximity to hardware, it's speed, and powerful feature set, 
makes it the obvious choice for modern embedded devices and the increasingly complex and challenging applications consuming them.

Yet, what most of don't know is that the world's most important systems and institutions also run on C++. The language has, by far, 
proven to be the most powerful tool available in modern software development, and the best tools lead to the best inventions.
Systems such as Linux, Windows, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and .NET Framework CLR were all written in C++. 
Relational database programs such as MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server and well-known non-relational (NO-SQL) database programs, 
such as MongoDB were also written in C++. In fact, even portions of the Apple OS have been written in C++! 
There's no question about it, the language seems to either form the foundation of well-known modern systems or it permeates them.

So, with the advent of these systems and the continued evolution to build upon them, we now end up with this massive
marketplace of different technologies, that at one point or another, required or will require interaction with those systems and
with each other.

An interaction known as interoperability. An unrestricted bridge between systems (of any kind).
