This project demonstrates the powerful capabilities of C++/CLI for native and managed interoperability 
using a real-world development scenario.

## Introduction

If you've ever developed for a company specializing in electronics or national defense, you've probably encountered your fair share 
of C++. Heck, C++'s proximity to hardware, speed and expanded feature set makes it the obvious development choice for modern embedded devices and the increasingly complex and challenging applications consuming them.

Yet, the world's most important systems and institutions also run on C++. Systems such as Linux, Windows, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and .NET Framework CLR were all written in C++. Relational database programs such as MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server were written in C++. Even well-known non-relational (NO-SQL) database programs, 
such as MongoDB were also written in C++. In fact, even portions of the Apple OS have been written in C++! 
There's no question about it, the language seems to either form the foundation of well-known modern systems or it permeates them. If the best tools lead to the best inventions, then C++ has proven to be the most powerful and flexible tool available in modern software development.

So, with the advent of these systems, we now end up with this massive marketplace of different technologies attempting to perfect, consume, build-upon, or communicate with these systems. Such interactions between systems (of any kind) is known as interoperability. In the software realm, we call it interop. An unrestricted bridge for information exchange.
